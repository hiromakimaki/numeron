## Numer0n
* `Numer0n` is a number guessing game, which is played by 2-players.
* Each player has 10 cards (0, 1, .., 9), chooses the 3 of them, and places them face down in a row.
* On your turn, you guess the opponent's cards.
* If the answer is wrong, you get the hint: the `hit` and `blow` numbers.
  * `hit`: The number of the cards both of which numbers and locatons are correct. 
  * `blow`: The number of the cards whose numbers are correct, but whose locations are wrong.
* If you can get the opponent's true cards (= 3 `hits`) before the opponent does, you win!

## Example
* The cards of the player A are "0", "4", and "7".
* The answer of the player B is "417".
* Then, the result is: 1 `hit` ("7") and 1 `blow` ("4").
